Creating a project on "Daily ONGC Production Insights with Power BI, Excel, and Python" would showcase your ability to handle, visualize, and analyze real-world oil and gas production data. Below is an overview of how you can structure the project:
1. Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains columns like 'Month,' 'ASSET,' 'AREA,' 'PROCESS PLATFORM/CTF,' 'Well Id,' 'Allocated Oil Production(SM3),' 'Daily Oil,' 'Daily Gas,' etc. It covers production metrics such as:

Oil Production: Amount of oil produced daily.
Gas Production: Both free and associated gas production.
Water Production: Allocated water production values.
Condensate Production: Daily condensate volumes.
These columns give insights into production at various levels (e.g., asset, platform, well).

2. Excel:
Purpose:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Excel will be used to clean the raw ONGC data (e.g., handling missing values, reformatting dates, renaming columns).
Initial Analysis: Perform initial data exploration using Excel's filtering, pivot tables, and charts to get a quick overview of daily production.
Data Organization: Structure the dataset for easy integration with Power BI and Python.
Steps:

Use Excel formulas for basic calculations such as daily production averages.
Create pivot tables to summarize production by Asset, Area, or Platform.
Prepare data for Power BI import by ensuring consistent formats and structure.
3. Power BI:
Purpose:

Visualizing Insights: Create interactive dashboards that allow users to explore ONGC production insights based on various slicers like asset, area, or well.
Comparing Metrics: Visualize trends for different production metrics (oil, gas, water) over time.
Dynamic Filtering: Enable users to filter by Asset, Month, or other dimensions to focus on specific production sites.
Key Visuals:

Column/Bar Charts: Show daily production of oil, gas, and water across different assets and platforms.
Line Charts: Visualize trends over time for daily oil and gas production, helping to identify production anomalies.
Slicers: Allow dynamic filtering by asset, area, or well.
KPIs: Show key production metrics (e.g., total daily oil production) at a glance.
Steps:

Import cleaned Excel data into Power BI.
Use DAX formulas to calculate metrics like cumulative production, monthly averages, or production rates.
Create a dashboard with intuitive visuals that respond to slicers and filters.
4. Python:
Purpose:

Advanced Data Analysis: Use Python for deeper data analysis, forecasting, or anomaly detection.
Data Automation: Automate repetitive tasks such as data cleaning, report generation, or fetching new production data.
Statistical Insights: Perform advanced statistical analysis and machine learning to predict future production trends or identify patterns.
Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Use Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy to clean and transform the ONGC data.
Data Analysis: Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to create plots showing correlations, trends, or anomalies in production data.
Predictive Modeling: Apply machine learning techniques (e.g., regression) to forecast future production based on historical data.
Integration with Power BI: Export processed data back to Excel or Power BI for further visualization.
Example Analyses:

Daily Production Trend Analysis: Plot daily oil and gas production to detect drops or spikes.
Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual production patterns using statistical methods or machine learning.
Predictive Forecasting: Predict oil production for the next day/week using historical data and regression models.
5. Key Insights:
At the end of the project, you will have:

Interactive Dashboards: Allow stakeholders to monitor ONGC's daily production at various levels.
Trend Analysis: Insights into oil and gas production trends, identifying high and low production periods.
Automation: Python scripts for repetitive data preprocessing tasks and advanced analytics.
Technologies Used:
Power BI: For visualization and reporting.
Excel: For data cleaning, preparation, and initial exploration.
Python: For advanced data analysis, automation, and forecasting.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates your data analytics, visualization, and automation skills by providing actionable insights into ONGCâ€™s daily production data. It also showcases your ability to use Power BI for dynamic reporting, Excel for efficient data handling, and Python for advanced data analysis.
